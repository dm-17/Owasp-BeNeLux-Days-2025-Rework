#  title   : How to use OWASP Security Champions Guide for your Security Champions Program
#  abstract: >-
#            As organizations scale their software development efforts, security 
#            often becomes a bottleneck in ensuring fast, reliable, and secure product 
#            releases. The OWASP Security Champions Guide, provides a robust framework 
#            for embedding security expertise within development teams, fostering a 
#            proactive security culture.</p>
#            <p>This talk will guide you through the Security Champions Manifesto and its 
#            ten principles. You will be guided through each principle as we cover the what, 
#            why and how. We will also highlight recent additions to the project and the 
#            roadmap for the next steps.</p>
#            <p>By the end of this session, you will have actionable insights into building 
#            and maintaining your own security champions program and how the OWASP Security 
#            Champions Guide can help you accelerate the implementation.

#  name    : Spandan Chandra
#  bio     : >- 
#            With over a decade of experience in cyber-security, risk management, and audits, 
#            I've had the opportunity to work with a range of organisations—from Fortune 500 
#            companies to SMBs—helping them secure their information assets and maintain 
#            compliance in an ever-evolving threat landscape. Throughout my career, I've 
#            focused on enhancing business efficiency, particularly through the strategic 
#            use of technology.</p>
#            <p>Today, as the co-founder of Secinnova, my focus is on how artificial 
#            intelligence can transform risk management and auditing processes. 
#            We support organisations to design solutions for automating key tasks 
#            and optimise human capital, allowing organisations to not only streamline 
#            compliance but also manage risk more effectively.</p>
#            <p>As we gather here at the OWASP Annual Conference, a hub of innovation 
#            and thought leadership in security, I;m excited to discuss the transformative 
#            potential of Gen-AI in IT risk management and auditing. Together, we'll 
#            explore how AI can enhance decision-making, reduce manual errors, and 
#            provide organisation with the tools they need to stay ahead in today's 
#            digital environment.</p>
#            <p>Let's dive into how AI can revolutionise the way we approach security, 
#            risk, and audits, and how we, as a community, can shape the future of these 
#            critical areas.
#  title   : Shifting Further Left - A novel way to integrate security through AI in Software design
#  abstract: >-
#            In recent years, DevSecOps has transformed how security integrates within the 
#            SDLC by embedding protective measures in the build and testing stages. <br />
#            Yet, there remains a critical need to introduce security even earlier in the 
#            design phase, where strategic decisions set the foundation for an application 
#            security posture.</p>
#            <p>In this talk I would like to present an innovative approach for embedding 
#            security from the very beginning of the software development lifecycle 
#            leveraging AI-driven insights to identify potential risks during design 
#            and provides actionable recommendations. As a result, development teams 
#            can reduce vulnerabilities, minimize costly fixes down the line, 
#            and build applications with robust, secure and compliant architecture from day one.

#  title   : Are you ready to be regulated? How the EU Cyber Resilience Act will change the software industry forever
#  abstract: >- 
#            The cost for the cybersecurity incidents all over the EU is too high. 
#            The EU believes that by regulating the cyber security of software, the total 
#            cost will go down as we get a more secure infrastructure in the home, in the 
#            office and everywhere we have networked systems. The regulation affects everything 
#            from embedded systems to servers, laptops and mobile apps. Development teams will 
#            have to focus on cybersecurity, companies will get responsibility for protecting 
#            their users and the software has to be secure by design from installation and 
#            during the lifetime of the product.</p>
#            <p>This will not only affect how we develop software, but also affects the 
#            business model for software.</p>
#            <p>Olle introduces the new regulation - how it affects both commercial 
#            vendors and Open Source projects.

#  title   : From Code to Cloud - Securing the Stack with Open-Source Tools
#  abstract: >-
#            Open-source tools offer a powerful, cost-effective solution for securing

#            walk through key tools that help protect your entire stack—from securing 
#            your codebase, to monitoring cloud environments, and automating vulnerability 
#            detection. We'll also discuss the strengths and limitations of open-source 
#            security tools, showing when they can be the perfect fit for your needs, 
#            and when proprietary or custom solutions may be more appropriate.</p>
#            <p>Attendees will see live demos of tools like OWASP ZAP, Trivy, Bandit, 
#            and Checkov to help them understand how to effectively incorporate these
